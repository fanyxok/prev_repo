\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have formalized the leakage of an MPC application %as a set of private inputs
bridging the language-level and protocol-level leakages
via security policies. Based on the formalization,
we have presented an approach to automatically synthesize a security policy
%that declare as few secret variables as possible but
which can improve the performance of the MPC applications while not compromising their privacy.
Our approach is essentially a synergistic integration of type inference and
symbolic reasoning with security type refinement.
We implemented our approach in a tool \TNAME.
The experimental results on five typical MPC applications confirm
that our approach can significantly improve
the performance of MPC applications.
